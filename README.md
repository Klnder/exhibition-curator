# Exhibition Creator

## About the project

The aim of this project is to collect a list of artworks from different Museums, and allow the user to search and filter through them, and create his own gallery.

For this project, I use artwork from two different API :

[Arts Institute of Chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/)  
[Cleveland Museum of Art](https://openaccess-api.clevelandart.org/)

The project is available here: [Go to Exhibition Curator](https://exhibitioncurator.netlify.app/home)

The project has been developed using React, Tailwind, and DaisyUI.

This project can be further developed with this kind of functionality :

- DB with users
- Further filters
- Further API
- save and load filters in the URL
